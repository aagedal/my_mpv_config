# My mpv config file
Just my personal mpv config file, if I need it on another machine. Use it if you wish.

- Deinterlacing is turned on. (I work with a lot of broadcast videoes.)
- Video is paused on startup and on end (like in QuickTIme).
- Window size has an fixed launch size.


Input config tries to replicate some NLE-like shortcuts. Not quite JKL, editing, but more intuitive I think.

K toggles Play and Pause.
J slows playback by 0.25% every time you press the key.
L speeds up playback by 0.25% every time you press the key.
I switches between playing forward and playing backwards.
